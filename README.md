Drone Signal Processing in Python

This Python code is designed to process signals received from drone communication systems. It focuses on estimating frequency offsets, shifting the frequency of signals, resampling, and visualizing spectrograms for better analysis. Here's a breakdown of the functionality:


---

1. Purpose

The script processes IQ data from drone communication signals.

It detects and analyzes frequency bands corresponding to different types of drone packets (droneid, c2, video).

It enables frequency offset correction and resampling for further signal processing or analysis.



---

2. Key Features

Frequency Offset Estimation: Identifies the frequency band where the signal is located and calculates the offset.

Frequency Shifting: Shifts the signal to baseband for easier processing.

Resampling: Adjusts the sampling rate to a desired lower rate for efficient processing.

Visualization: Provides spectrograms and Power Spectral Density (PSD) plots for debugging and analysis.

3. Functions and Their Roles

__init__(self, debug=True):
Initializes the processor and enables debugging for detailed output and visualizations.

fshift(y, offset, Fs):
Performs frequency shifting of the input signal y by a specified offset in Hz using complex exponential multiplication.

consecutive(data, stepsize=1):
Groups consecutive elements in an array based on a step size. Used to identify frequency bands.

estimate_offset(y, Fs, packet_type):

Applies Welchâ€™s method to calculate the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the signal.

Identifies candidate frequency bands based on PSD thresholding.

Matches bands to the expected bandwidths for different packet types (droneid, c2, video).

Outputs the frequency offset and whether a suitable band was found.


process_file(file_path, sampling_rate, resample_rate, packet_type):

Reads the IQ data file containing the drone signal.

Estimates the frequency offset using estimate_offset.

Shifts the frequency to baseband using fshift.

Resamples the signal to the desired rate using the resample function (imported from Filter module).

Visualizes spectrograms of both the original and processed signals.

4. How It Works

1. Input Data: The script reads a binary file containing complex IQ samples of the signal.


2. Offset Estimation: It identifies the frequency band containing the signal and calculates the offset to shift it to baseband.


3. Frequency Shifting: Applies the offset to the signal, centering it at zero frequency.


4. Resampling: If the sampling rate exceeds the target resample rate, it reduces the sampling rate using the resample function.


5. Visualization: The script provides spectrograms for both the baseband and resampled signals, aiding in understanding the processing stages.

5. Example Usage

file_path = '/path/to/signal.dat'  # Path to the input IQ data file
sampling_rate = 50e6              # Original sampling rate (50 MHz)
resample_rate = 11e6              # Target resample rate (11 MHz)

processor = DroneSignalProcessor(debug=True)  # Enable debugging
processed_data = processor.process_file(
    file_path, sampling_rate, resample_rate, packet_type="droneid"
)

The script processes the data and visualizes spectrograms and PSD plots for debugging.

Adjust the packet_type to droneid, c2, or video to match the expected signal bandwidth.

6. Requirements

Python Packages:
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

numpy

scipy

matplotlib


Data Format:
Input signal file should contain complex IQ samples stored as complex64.

7. Visualization

The script generates the following visualizations:

Power Spectral Density (PSD): Helps identify frequency bands of interest.

Spectrograms: Displays the time-frequency representation of the signal, both before and after processing.

8. Applications

Drone communication signal analysis and processing.

Frequency offset correction for real-time or offline signal processing.

Signal preparation for modulation/demodulation and further analysis
